## Overview

CountryQuiz is a web app, built using the REST Countries API, that is focused on being both fun and educational.

It provides varying levels of difficulty depending on which region of the world a user selects, and their own pre-existing knowledge of that region, and this provides continued enjoyment and learning through repeated playthroughs.
